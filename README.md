## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This repository contains an implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful approach to combine information retrieval and text generation. RAG uses external knowledge bases to enhance the generative capabilities of large language models, offering better, fact-based responses. This repository implements RAG to various NLP tasks that benefit from grounded, context-aware generation. You can customize this implementation to suit different retrieval backends (e.g., ElasticSearch, FAISS) and models (e.g., GPT, BERT-based models).

#### Implementation

1. Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/VarunSwaminathan/Retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG-.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd Retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt


#### Results
The RAG model is capable of providing grounded answers that combine the knowledge from the retrieved documents with the generative power of the language model. This method can significantly improve performance on tasks like question answering and summarization, especially when the training data is limited or needs external knowledge.
